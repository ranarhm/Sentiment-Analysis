### Introduction
The increasing popularity of social media provided the opportunity to people to share their
thoughts on the web. Twitter is one of the most popular microblogging services on which users
create their opinions about different topics in the form of messages that are called ‘tweets’.
Tweets are often useful in understanding the opinions of the people. However, there are so
many tweets that it can be hard for businesses to prioritize which to respond first. In order to
compute the customer perception and provide marketing strategies, we need to develop an
automated machine learning model. Sentiment analysis has become a solution to tackle this
problem; in Twitter, it is the interpretation and classification of emotions of people’s opinions on
a particular subject using text analysis techniques. In general, sentiment includes classifying
statements as positive, negative or neutral.
Our goal is to carefully inspect the people’s thoughts on Twitter using sentiment analysis tools
such as natural language processing or NLP which plays a bridging role with the machine
learning to understand humans in their Natural Language.

### Project Problem Statement
The problem we are trying to solve through this project is to analyze user emotions and opinions
expressed in tweets. Twitter allows companies, organizations and businesses to engage with
the customers personally, to understand their audience and what they say about their brand and
as a result they can discover significant trends in industry. In the past, analyzing tweets was a
manual and very time-consuming process as it required groups of people to go through
messages and label them according to their emotions. Here, we will try to implement a Twitter
sentiment analysis model that classifies positive and negative tweets in text format, to overcome
the challenges of identifying the emotions of the tweets. Our goal is to understand the role of a
machine learning model that identifies the tweets with negative sentiment from positive in
Twitter social media platform. This method enables companies to monitor customer sentiment in
many different cases.
